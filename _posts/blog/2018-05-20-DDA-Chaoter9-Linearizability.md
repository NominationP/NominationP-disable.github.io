## Linearizability


- The basic idea behind linearizability is simple: to make a system appear as if there is only a single copy of the data.
- Can’t we maybe find a more efficient implementation of linearizable storage? It seems the answer is no
- In Chapter 12 we will discuss some approaches for avoiding linearizability without sacrificing correctness.
